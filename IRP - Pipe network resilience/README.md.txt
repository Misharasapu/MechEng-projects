# Improving the Resilience of Pipe Networks to Cold Spells using Machine Learning

## Summary
This research project explores the application of Q-learning, a form of reinforcement learning, to enhance the resilience of gas pipe networks during extreme cold events. By creating a simulated gas pipe network using the pandapipes framework, this study aims to dynamically suggest mitigation strategies to maintain or quickly restore gas pressure to safe operational levels. The approach leverages machine learning to predict and manage increased demand scenarios effectively, thus supporting the broader goals of enhancing infrastructure resilience and operational efficiency in the face of climate variability.
